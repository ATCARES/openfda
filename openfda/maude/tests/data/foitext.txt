538836|1861364|D|1|06/18/2004|MFG RECEIVED REPORT FROM A PERFUSIONIST INVOLVING 3 DEVICES RELATED TO A SINGLE EVENT AND DESCRIBIN THE FOLLOWING ETIOLOGY PT WITH PATHOLOGY OF DILATED CARDIO MYOPATHY UNDERWENT SURGICAL PROCEDURE FOR LVAD BRIDGE-TO-TRANSPLANT IMPLANTATION UNDER FULL HEPARININIZATION (3MG/KG). SURGERY COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY AND PT TRANSFERRED TO ICU. POST SURGICAL ICU GOAL WAS TO KEEP ACT RESULTS AT OR ABOUT 250 SECONDS USING HEMOCHRON 401 K-ACT DEVICE TO MINIMIZE CHANCE OF CLOT OR FIBRIN DEPOSITION. WHILE IN ICU, PT POST-OPERATIVE BLEEDING STOPPED BY DAY ONE POST-OP AND PT SHOWED NO SIGN OF COAGULOPATHY. HEPARIN DRIP ADMINISTRATION IN ICU MONITORED USING HEMOCHRON JR. ACT-LR DEVICE WITH RESULTS ABOVE 250 SECONDS. ON DAY THREE POST-OP, PT GIVEN BOLUS OF HEPARIN TO FACILITATE DIALYSIS PROCEDURE. POST DIALYSIS, HEPARIN DRIP WAS DISCONTINUED. SIX HOURS AFTER BOLUS WITHOUT HEPARIN DRIP, HEMOCHRON JR. ACT-LR VALUES CONSISTENTLY YIELDING OUT OF RANGE (>400 SECONDS) RESULT HOURLY WITH PT NOT SHOWING SIGNS OF BLEEDING. AT DIRECTION OF PERFUSIONIST, OR ACT DEVICE (GEM PCL HR-ACT), WAS USED TO MEASURE PT'S ACT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATE READING AND DETERINE IF HEPARIN DRIP RE-INITIATION WAS REQUIRED. FRESHLY DRAWN BLOOD SAMPLES WERE RUN SIMULTANEOUSLY ON GEM PCL HR-ACT AND HEMOCHRON JR. ACT-LR. PCL STOPPED AT 278 SECONDS & HEMOCHRON JR OUT OF RANGE (>400 SECONDS). TEST REPEATED WITH DIFFERENT LOT OF PCL ACT CARTRIDGES. RESULTS - GEM PCL STOPPED AT 231 SECONDS AND HEMOCHRON JR. YIELDED SIMILIAR OUT-OF-RANGE RESULT. A STAT PTT DRAWN AND SENT TO LAB. RESULT WAS > 150 SECONDS. REPORTER RECOMMENDED RUNNING ACT'S AGAIN ON HEMOCHRON 401 INSTRUMENT FROM OR WITH K-ACT DISPOSABLE, AND ON A 2ND PCL DEVICE WITH HR-ACT. SUBSEQUENTLY, ACT'S WERE REPEATED ON HEMOCHRON 401 K-ACT, HEMOCHRON JR. ACT-LR AND OTHER GEM PCL HR-ACT. RESULTS WERE HEMOCHRON 401, 308 SECONDS. REPORTER STATED A DECISION MADE TO TREAT LOWEST ACT VALUE OBTAINED IN AN EFFORT TO PREVENT ANY THROMOBOSIS AND SUBSEQUENT DEVICE (LVAD) FAILIURE. HEPARIN DRIP RE-INITIATED AND ICU NURSES INFORMED TO USE HEMOCHRON JR. TO MONITOR ACT'S TO 250-300 SECONDS. GEM PCL & HEMOCHRON 401 WERE RETURNED TO OR. SUBSEQUENTLY, PT BEGAN BLEEDING FROM UNSPECIFIED LOCATIONS. PT RETURNED TO OR ON DAY 5 POST-OP TO CORRECT CARDIAC TAMPONADE DUE TO LARGE AMOUNT OF BLOOD IN CHEST SURROUNDING LVAD DEVICE. PT TRANSFUSED WITH MULTIPLE UNITS AND TRANSPORTED TO ICU IN STABILIZED CONDITION. BLEEDING CONTINUED OVERNIGHT AND PT BROUGHT BACK TO OR ON FOLLOWING DAY FOR ADDITIONAL TREATMENT. SURGEONS COULD NOT IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC PHYSICAL SOURCE OF BLEEDING NOR ATTRIBUTE CAUSE FOR COAGULOPATHY AS COAGULATION PROFILE WAS NEAR NORMAL RANGES. REPORTER INDICATED THAT FACILITY STAFF DETERMINED FURTHER HEROIC EFFORTS SHOULD BE WITHHELD AT THIS TIME. SUBSEQUENTLY DONOR HEART MADE AVAILABLE LATE THAT NIGHT AND PT SUCCESSFULLY TRANSPLANTED EARLY NEXT MORNING.
538836|1861367|N||06/18/2004|ETIOLOGY OF EVENT INVOLVES 3 DEVICES (MFG RPT NO.S 2248721-2004-00001, 2248721-2004-00002 & 2248721-2004-00003 FOR IN-VITRO DIAGNOSTIC ACT HEPARIN LEVEL DETERMINATIONS BY CLOTTING TIME. INITIAL REPORTER CONTACTED BY MFR. ADVISED BY MFR THAT REPORTED CLOTTING TIME TEST RESULTS FOR HR-ACT, ACT-LR AND K-ACT WERE CONSISTENT WITH EXPECTED VALUES BASED ON THE REPORTED ANTICOAGULANT REGIMEN AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH MFR'S LABELING. REPORTER FURTHER INSTRUCTED THAT ACT-LR AND HR-ACT VALUES ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE AS EACH ONE IS DESIGNED AND SPECIFIED BY LABELLING INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE FOR SPECIFIC HEPARIN DOSE RANGES. REPORTER ALSO ADVISED THAT PER MFR'S LABELLING/INSTRUCTIONS, CLOTTING TIME TESTS USED DURING THE REPORTED EVENT (K-ACT, ACT-LR & HR-ACT) ARE NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE EQUIVALENT RESULTS AND USERS ARE WARNED TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE CORRELATIONS SPECIFIC TO THEIR USE PRIOR TO ATTEMPTING DIRECT COMPARISONS OF RESULTS. REPORTER INDICATED THAT HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL AT SITE DO NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN TEST TYPES. REPORTER CONFIRMED THAT DEVICES INVOLVED IN ADVERSE EVENT DISCARDED AFTER USE.
1511544|7098023|D|1||AT THE END OF AN RF PROCEDURE, IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE PT SUSTAINED A SECOND DEGREE BURN WHERE THE NEEDLE WAS PLACED IN A SKIN FOLD ON THE BACK. THE BURN WAS 2 CM IN SIZE AND LOCATED IN THE LUMBAR REGION. THE BURN WAS TREATED WITH NEOSPORIN AND TEGADERM DRESSING. ORAL ANTIBIOTICS WERE ALSO PRESCRIBED. SCARRING IS EXPECTED.
1511544|7098031|N|1||THE CUSTOMER CONFIRMED THAT THE PRODUCT WILL NOT BE RETURNED FOR EVAL. THE CUSTOMER INDICATED THAT THE PT HAS BEEN SEEN POST OP, AND REPORTS NO OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES.
